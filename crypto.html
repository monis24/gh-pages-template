    <h2>Ethereum Addresses</h2>

    <h3>Positive Test Cases</h3>

    <p>Ethereum addresses play a crucial role in the world of cryptocurrency. These unique identifiers are essential for sending and receiving Ether and other tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. A typical Ethereum address, such as <span style="color: blue;">0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e</span>, consists of 42 characters, including the '0x' prefix. Another example of a valid Ethereum address is <span style="color: blue;">0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48</span>, which demonstrates the mix of lowercase and uppercase letters commonly found in these addresses.</p>

    <p>The structure of Ethereum addresses is designed to ensure uniqueness and security. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678</span> and <span style="color: blue;">0xABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12</span> are both valid Ethereum addresses, showcasing the range of characters that can be used. It's worth noting that even addresses with repeated characters, such as <span style="color: blue;">0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000A</span> or <span style="color: blue;">0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff</span>, are valid and can be used as wallet addresses on the Ethereum network.</p>

    <h3>Negative Test Cases</h3>

    <p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

    <p>While Ethereum addresses follow a specific format, it's important to recognize invalid patterns. For example, <span style="color: blue;">0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44</span> is missing the last character, making it an invalid address. Similarly, <span style="color: blue;">0xG0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48</span> contains the letter 'G', which is not part of the valid hexadecimal character set for Ethereum addresses. Addresses that are too short, like <span style="color: blue;">0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567</span>, or too long, such as <span style="color: blue;">0xABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF123</span>, are also invalid.</p>

    <p>Other common mistakes in Ethereum addresses include using the wrong prefix, as seen in <span style="color: blue;">1x000000000000000000000000000000000000000A</span>, or including invalid characters like in <span style="color: blue;">0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffg</span>. It's also important to note that Ethereum addresses are case-sensitive, so <span style="color: blue;">0X123456789012345678901234567890123456789a</span> is invalid due to the uppercase 'X' in the prefix. Addresses without the '0x' prefix, such as <span style="color: blue;">123456789012345678901234567890123456789a</span>, are also not valid Ethereum addresses.</p>

    <h2>Bitcoin Addresses</h2>

    <h3>Positive Test Cases</h3>

    <p>Bitcoin addresses are fundamental to the Bitcoin network, serving as unique identifiers for sending and receiving Bitcoin. A standard Bitcoin address, such as <span style="color: blue;">1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2</span>, typically consists of 26-35 alphanumeric characters. Another example of a valid Bitcoin address is <span style="color: blue;">3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy</span>, which demonstrates a different format starting with '3', indicating a script hash address.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin addresses can take various forms, each with its own characteristics. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">1KFHE7w8BhaENAswwryaoccDb9fT1fhwBq</span> and <span style="color: blue;">3Nxwenay9Z8Lc9JBiTB1rkD8jZPMgX5oKB</span> are both valid addresses, showcasing the diversity in their structure. It's worth noting that some Bitcoin addresses hold historical significance, such as <span style="color: blue;">1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa</span>, which is believed to be Satoshi Nakamoto's address from the genesis block. Other valid examples include <span style="color: blue;">3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r</span> and <span style="color: blue;">3P3QsMVK89JBNqZQv5zMAKG8FK3kJM4rjq</span>, demonstrating the range of possible Bitcoin addresses.</p>

    <h3>Negative Test Cases</h3>

    <p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

    <p>While Bitcoin addresses follow specific formats, it's crucial to recognize invalid patterns. For example, <span style="color: blue;">4J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy</span> is invalid because Bitcoin addresses don't start with '4'. Similarly, <span style="color: blue;">2BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2</span> is not a valid address as '2' is not a standard starting character for Bitcoin addresses. Addresses that are too long, such as <span style="color: blue;">1KFHE7w8BhaENAswwryaoccDb9fT1fhwBqO</span> and <span style="color: blue;">3Nxwenay9Z8Lc9JBiTB1rkD8jZPMgX5oKBI</span>, are also invalid.</p>

    <p>Other common mistakes in Bitcoin addresses include using the wrong starting character, as seen in <span style="color: blue;">0A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa</span>, or having an incorrect length like <span style="color: blue;">3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r1234</span>. It's also important to note that Bitcoin addresses are case-sensitive and must not contain characters outside the allowed set. An address like <span style="color: blue;">3P3QsMVK89JBNqZQv5zMAKG8FK3kJM4rjqO</span> is invalid due to the 'O' at the end, which is not part of the Base58 character set used for Bitcoin addresses.</p>
