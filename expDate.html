    <h2>Positive Test Cases</h2>

    <p>Credit card expiration dates are crucial for verifying the validity of a card. Common formats include 01/2023, 02-2024, and 03/25, which represent month and year combinations. These dates are essential for card expiration checks and ensuring transactions are processed with up-to-date information.</p>

    <p>When discussing credit card expiration dates, it's important to note that they typically follow a specific pattern. Examples such as 05/2027, 06-2028, and 07/29 demonstrate the variety of formats used. These dates are critical for maintaining card security and preventing fraudulent transactions after a card has expired.</p>

    <h2>Negative Test Cases</h2>

    <p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

    <p>Incorrect or invalid expiration date formats can cause issues in processing and verification. Examples of such formats include <span style="color: blue;">00/2023, 13-2024, and 1/25</span>, which do not conform to standard month/year patterns. These formats may be rejected by payment systems or flagged for further verification.</p>

    <p>Similarly, unconventional separators or additional digits can lead to errors in expiration date recognition. Instances like <span style="color: blue;">04.26, 05_2027, and 06 2028</span> deviate from typical formats. More complex examples such as <span style="color: blue;">07/2029/30, 08-230, and 234-03-2025</span> further illustrate potential issues with non-standard date representations in financial contexts.</p>
