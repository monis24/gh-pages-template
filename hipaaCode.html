    <h3>Positive Test Cases</h3>

    <p>HIPAA ICD-10 codes are crucial in the healthcare industry for classifying diseases, symptoms, and procedures. These codes follow specific patterns and formats. For example, <span style="color: blue;">V31VY6</span> and <span style="color: blue;">V9BKV1</span> are valid ICD-10 codes, demonstrating the alphanumeric nature of these identifiers. Another valid code format is represented by <span style="color: blue;">X99.O</span>, which includes a decimal point. The International Classification of Diseases system also encompasses codes like <span style="color: blue;">B826O30</span> and <span style="color: blue;">O37.30W</span>, showcasing the variety in length and structure.</p>

    <p>ICD-10 codes can vary in complexity and specificity. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">L92</span> is a valid, simpler code, while <span style="color: blue;">Q98I</span> represents another format. More complex codes such as <span style="color: blue;">B5AXRKZ</span> and <span style="color: blue;">C91.6QK</span> illustrate the range of possibilities within the ICD-10 standard. These codes are essential for HIPAA compliance and accurate medical record-keeping, ensuring proper diagnosis coding and procedure classification in healthcare settings.</p>

    <h3>Negative Test Cases</h3>

    <p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

    <p>While ICD-10 codes follow specific patterns, it's crucial to recognize invalid formats. For example, <span style="color: blue;">U12.3456</span> and <span style="color: blue;">A23C.789T</span> are not valid ICD-10 codes due to their incorrect structure and excessive length after the decimal point. Similarly, <span style="color: blue;">B34.ABCDE</span> contains too many alphabetic characters after the decimal, which is not consistent with ICD-10 formatting rules. Codes like <span style="color: blue;">C45B.123U</span> and <span style="color: blue;">E67B,XYZ</span> are invalid due to the presence of a comma or an incorrect placement of letters.</p>

    <p>Other examples of incorrectly formatted ICD-10 codes include <span style="color: blue;">U78.9A10</span>, which has an invalid combination of numbers and letters after the decimal point. <span style="color: blue;">G89A-12</span> is incorrect due to the presence of a hyphen, which is not used in ICD-10 codes. <span style="color: blue;">H90B.12345</span> and <span style="color: blue;">I01.3456U</span> are invalid because they contain too many digits after the decimal point, exceeding the standard format for ICD-10 codes. These examples highlight the importance of adhering to the specific formatting rules of the International Classification of Diseases system for proper HIPAA compliance and accurate medical coding.</p>
