<h1>US Passport Number</h1>

<p>US passport numbers are unique identifiers assigned to each passport issued by the United States government. Valid passport numbers typically consist of nine characters, either all numeric or a combination of one letter followed by eight digits. For example, <span style="color: blue;">A12345678</span>, <span style="color: blue;">B98765432</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">C00000000</span> are all valid passport numbers. The passport ID system also recognizes numbers like <span style="color: blue;">D11111111</span> and <span style="color: blue;">E99999999</span> as legitimate identifiers.</p>

<p>Other examples of valid US passport numbers include <span style="color: blue;">F01234567</span>, <span style="color: blue;">G98765432</span>, <span style="color: blue;">H55555555</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">I87654321</span>. It's worth noting that while most modern US passport numbers begin with a letter, some older passports may have all-numeric identifiers, such as <span style="color: blue;">123456789</span>, which is also considered valid.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Invalid US passport numbers can take various forms, often deviating from the standard nine-character format. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">A1234567</span> and <span style="color: blue;">E9999999</span> are too short, while <span style="color: blue;">B987654321</span> and <span style="color: blue;">I876543210</span> are too long to be valid passport numbers. The passport number system also rejects identifiers that don't follow the correct alphanumeric pattern, such as <span style="color: blue;">c12345678</span> (lowercase first letter) or <span style="color: blue;">D1234567A</span> (letter at the end).</p>

<p>Other examples of invalid passport numbers include those with incorrect formatting or characters. For example, <span style="color: blue;">F0123456A</span> has a letter in the wrong position, <span style="color: blue;">1G8765432</span> starts with a number instead of a letter, <span style="color: blue;">H5555555</span> is missing a digit, and <span style="color: blue;">J-12345678</span> contains a hyphen, which is not allowed in US passport numbers. These formats do not comply with the US passport number standards and should not be recognized as valid identifiers.</p>
