<h1>ABA Routing Number</h1>

<h2>Formatted (High Confidence Level)</h2>

<p>ABA routing numbers, also known as routing transit numbers (RTN), are crucial identifiers in the American banking system. Properly formatted ABA numbers typically appear with hyphens separating the digits into groups. Valid examples include <span style="color: blue;">0123-4567-8</span>, <span style="color: blue;">1234-5678-9</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">2345-6789-0</span>. These formatted numbers provide a high level of confidence in identifying legitimate routing numbers used by financial institutions.</p>

<p>Other valid formats for ABA routing numbers include <span style="color: blue;">3012-3456-7</span>, <span style="color: blue;">6789-0123-4</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">7012-3456-7</span>. Additionally, some systems may represent the numbers with a single hyphen, such as <span style="color: blue;">01234567-8</span>, <span style="color: blue;">12345678-9</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">23456789-0</span>. All these formats are recognized as valid representations of ABA routing numbers by the American Banking Association.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Invalid ABA routing numbers often have incorrect digit patterns or formatting. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">1323-4567-8</span> and <span style="color: blue;">3345-6789-0</span> do not follow the proper numerical sequence for valid routing numbers. Similarly, numbers starting with 4, 5, or 9, such as <span style="color: blue;">4012-3456-7</span>, <span style="color: blue;">5789-0123-4</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">9012-3456-7</span>, are not used in the ABA routing system.</p>

<p>Other examples of invalid formatted ABA numbers include those with incorrect groupings like <span style="color: blue;">0123-456-78</span> or <span style="color: blue;">1234-5678-90</span>. Numbers that are too short (<span style="color: blue;">2345-6789</span>) or contain non-numeric characters (<span style="color: blue;">3012-3456-7A</span>) are also invalid. These formats do not comply with the ABA routing number standards and should not be recognized as valid identifiers.</p>

<h2>Unformatted (High to Low Confidence)</h2>

<p>Unformatted ABA routing numbers appear as a continuous string of nine digits without any separators. Valid examples include <span style="color: blue;">012345678</span>, <span style="color: blue;">123456789</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">234567890</span>. These numbers, while lacking hyphens, still represent legitimate routing transit numbers used in the American banking system. Other valid unformatted ABA numbers are <span style="color: blue;">301234567</span>, <span style="color: blue;">678901234</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">701234567</span>.</p>

<p>Additional instances of valid unformatted ABA routing numbers include <span style="color: blue;">801234567</span>, <span style="color: blue;">012345678</span> (repeated from above), <span style="color: blue;">123456789</span> (repeated), and <span style="color: blue;">234567890</span> (repeated). While these numbers lack the clear formatting of hyphenated versions, they still contain the necessary nine digits to represent full ABA routing numbers used by financial institutions.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Invalid unformatted ABA routing numbers often have incorrect digit patterns or lengths. For example, <span style="color: blue;">132345678</span> and <span style="color: blue;">334567890</span> do not follow the proper numerical sequence for valid routing numbers. Numbers starting with 4, 5, 8, or 9, such as <span style="color: blue;">401234567</span>, <span style="color: blue;">578901234</span>, <span style="color: blue;">811234567</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">901234567</span>, are not used in the ABA routing system.</p>

<p>Other examples of invalid unformatted ABA numbers include those with incorrect lengths, such as <span style="color: blue;">01234567</span> (too short) or <span style="color: blue;">1234567890</span> (too long). Numbers that contain non-numeric characters, like <span style="color: blue;">301234567A</span>, are also invalid. These formats do not comply with the ABA routing number standards and should not be recognized as valid identifiers in financial transactions or systems.</p>
