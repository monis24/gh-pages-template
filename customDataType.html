  <h1 style="font-size: 2em;">Regex Test: Workspaces Secure Browser</h1>

  <p>This page is to test this regex <code>(?&lt;=\bworkspaces\s)secure(?=\sbrowser)(?!\stesting)(?<!aws\s)</code>, which utilizes:
    <ul>
      <li>a positive lookbehind to ensure the word "secure" is preceded by "workspaces",</li>
      <li>a positive lookahead to ensure "secure" is followed by "browser",</li>
      <li>a negative lookahead to ensure "secure" is not followed by "testing",</li>
      <li>and a negative lookbehind to ensure "workspaces secure browser" is not following "aws".</li>
    </ul>
    So we will match and redact "workspaces secure browser" but only if it does not follow "aws" or is not followed by "testing".
  </p>

  <h2>Positive Test Cases</h2>

  <p>In our organization, it's important to prioritize security, which is why we focus on providing a reliable <span style="color: blue;">workspaces secure browser</span> for all users. This setup ensures compliance and reduces risks associated with traditional browsing environments.</p>

  <p>For example, the <span style="color: blue;">workspaces secure browser</span> setup allows safe access to critical applications without compromising user experience. This solution is particularly valuable in shared environments where <span style="color: blue;">workspaces secure browser</span> configurations are essential.</p>

  <h3>Negative Test Cases</h3>

  <p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

  <p>When testing, ensure that the configuration doesn't inadvertently activate for phrases like <span style="color: red;">workspaces secure browser testing</span>. Additionally, make sure the regex excludes other similar patterns, such as <span style="color: red;">workspaces secure browser testing</span>, to avoid false positives.</p>

  <p>Also, ensure the phrase does not match when it follows "aws", as in <span style="color: red;">aws workspaces secure browser</span>. This setup should only apply to configurations without the preceding "aws" keyword.</p>
