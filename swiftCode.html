<h1>SWIFT Code</h1>

<p>SWIFT codes, also known as BIC (Bank Identifier Codes) or ISO 9362 codes, are unique identifiers for banks and financial institutions in international transactions. Valid SWIFT codes typically consist of 8 or 11 characters. For example, <span style="color: blue;">BOFAUS3NXXX</span> is a valid 11-character SWIFT code, while <span style="color: blue;">DEUTDEFF</span> is a valid 8-character code. These codes are crucial for ensuring accurate routing of international financial transactions.</p>

<p>Other examples of valid SWIFT codes include <span style="color: blue;">CHASUS33</span>, <span style="color: blue;">MIDLGB22</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">BNPAFRPP</span>. The structure of a SWIFT code typically includes the bank code (4 characters), country code (2 characters), location code (2 characters), and optionally, a branch code (3 characters). This standardized format allows for efficient and precise identification of financial institutions worldwide.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Invalid SWIFT codes often deviate from the standard 8 or 11-character format. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">BOFAUS3NXX</span> is invalid because it has 10 characters, which doesn't conform to either the 8 or 11-character standard. Similarly, <span style="color: blue;">DEUTDEF</span> is too short with only 7 characters, while <span style="color: blue;">CHASUS333</span> is incorrect as the branch code (last 3 characters) should only be present in 11-character codes.</p>

<p>Other examples of invalid SWIFT codes include <span style="color: blue;">MIDLGB2</span>, which is too short at 7 characters, and <span style="color: blue;">BNPAFRPPP1</span>, which exceeds the maximum length of 11 characters. It's important to note that SWIFT codes must adhere strictly to the format specifications to be considered valid in the international banking system. Codes that don't meet these criteria should not be recognized as legitimate SWIFT/BIC codes.</p>
