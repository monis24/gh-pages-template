These numbers, while lacking traditional formatting, still represent legitimate phone numbers. Other valid unformatted examples are <span style="color: blue;">+1(123)4567890</span> and <span style="color: blue;">11234567890</span>, which include country codes.</p>

<p>Additional instances of valid unformatted phone numbers include <span style="color: blue;">2345678901</span>, <span style="color: blue;">+12345678901</span>, <span style="color: blue;">(234)5678901</span>, <span style="color: blue;">12345678901</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">+1(234)5678901</span>.

<p>In the context of unformatted phone numbers, examples with clear formatting should not be included. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">+1 123 456 7890</span>, <span style="color: blue;">123-456-7890</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">123.456.7890</span> are considered formatted numbers and should not be treated as unformatted. Similarly, numbers like <span style="color: blue;">+1 (123) 456-7890</span> and <span style="color: blue;">123 456 7890</span> have distinct separators that place them in the formatted category.</p>

<p>Other examples that should not be considered as unformatted phone numbers include <span style="color: blue;">+1-123-456-7890</span>, <span style="color: blue;">(123) 456-7890</span>, <span style="color: blue;">+1 123.456.7890</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">123 - 456 - 7890</span>. These numbers all contain clear formatting elements such as spaces, hyphens, or parentheses that separate the digits into distinct groups, making them formatted rather than unformatted phone numbers.</p>
