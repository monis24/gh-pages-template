    <h1 style="font-size: 2em;">IP Addresses</h1>

    <h2>Positive Test Cases</h2>

    <p>IP addresses are crucial for identifying devices on a network. Common formats include <span style="color: blue;">192.168.0.1, 10.0.0.1, and 172.16.0.1</span>, which are often used in local networks. These addresses are essential for routing data packets and ensuring proper network communication.</p>

    <p>When discussing IP addresses, it's important to note that they can cover a wide range of values. Examples such as <span style="color: blue;">255.255.255.255, 0.0.0.0, and 1.2.3.4</span> demonstrate the variety of valid IP addresses. Other common IP addresses include <span style="color: blue;">123.45.67.89, 255.0.0.1, 192.168.255.1, and 8.8.8.8</span>, which are used in various network configurations and services.</p>

    <h2>Negative Test Cases</h2>

    <p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

    <p>Incorrect or invalid IP address formats can cause issues in network configuration and routing. Examples of such invalid formats include <span style="color: blue;">256.0.0.1, 192.168.0.256, and 1.2.3.4.5</span>, which do not conform to the standard IPv4 format. These invalid addresses would be rejected by network devices and software.</p>

    <p>Similarly, incomplete or malformed IP addresses can lead to errors in network communication. Instances like <span style="color: blue;">192.168.0, 192.168.0.1.2, and 256.256.256.256</span> are invalid. More examples of incorrect IP addresses include <span style="color: blue;">192.168.000.001, ...., and 192.168.0.1.</span>, which further illustrate potential issues with non-standard IP address representations in networking contexts.</p>
