<h1>Time</h1>

<p>Time formats can vary widely, but certain standards are commonly used and recognized. Valid time formats include both 12-hour and 24-hour notations. For example, <span style="color: blue;">12:30</span> and <span style="color: blue;">23:59</span> are valid representations in the 24-hour format. In the 12-hour format, times like <span style="color: blue;">1:05 PM</span> are used, including the AM/PM indicator. These formats provide clear and unambiguous ways to express time.</p>

<p>More detailed time representations can include seconds and even fractions of seconds. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">14:30:45</span> shows hours, minutes, and seconds in the 24-hour format. For even more precision, times like <span style="color: blue;">09:15:30.123456</span> include microseconds. The 12-hour format can also include seconds, as in <span style="color: blue;">3:45:00 AM</span>. These various formats accommodate different levels of precision needed in different contexts.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Invalid time formats often violate the basic rules of time representation. For example, <span style="color: blue;">24:00</span> is not a valid 24-hour time (midnight should be represented as 00:00). Similarly, <span style="color: blue;">12:60</span> is invalid because minutes cannot exceed 59. Formats that mix 12-hour and 24-hour conventions incorrectly, such as <span style="color: blue;">1:30:00 PM AM</span>, are also invalid.</p>

<p>Other examples of invalid time formats include those with excessive precision, like <span style="color: blue;">09:15:30.1234567</span>, which has too many decimal places for microseconds. Times with impossible values, such as <span style="color: blue;">3:65</span> (invalid minutes) or <span style="color: blue;">25:30:45 PM</span> (hours exceeding 24 and incorrectly using PM), are not valid. These formats do not conform to standard time representation rules and should not be recognized as legitimate time expressions.</p>
