<h1>National Drug Code</h1>

<h2>Formatted NDC (High Confidence Level)</h2>

<p>The National Drug Code (NDC) is a unique, three-segment number assigned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to human drugs in the United States. Properly formatted NDCs include <span style="color: blue;">1234-5678-90</span>, <span style="color: blue;">12345-678-90</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">12345-6789-0</span>. These codes are essential for identifying and tracking medications throughout the healthcare system.</p>

<p>Other valid examples of formatted NDCs include <span style="color: blue;">12345-6789-01</span>, <span style="color: blue;">9876-5432-10</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">98765-432-10</span>. The FDA code system also recognizes NDCs such as <span style="color: blue;">98765-4321-2</span>, <span style="color: blue;">56789-0123-45</span>, <span style="color: blue;">23456-789-01</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">34567-8901-2</span> as valid drug identification numbers.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Incorrectly formatted NDCs can take various forms. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">123-4567-890</span> and <span style="color: blue;">12345-67-890</span> have incorrect segment lengths. Similarly, <span style="color: blue;">1234-56789-0</span> and <span style="color: blue;">12345-6789-012</span> do not follow the proper format. Other invalid examples include <span style="color: blue;">1234-5678-9</span> (too short in the last segment) and <span style="color: blue;">123456-789-01</span> (first segment too long).</p>

<p>Additional examples of invalid NDCs include <span style="color: blue;">12345-6789</span> (missing the third segment), <span style="color: blue;">1234-5678-90-12</span> (extra segment), <span style="color: blue;">12345-678-9a</span> (contains a letter), and <span style="color: blue;">abcd-efgh-ij</span> (entirely non-numeric). These formats do not comply with the FDA's National Drug Code standards and should not be recognized as valid medication identification numbers.</p>

<h2>Unformatted NDC (Medium/Low Confidence)</h2>

<p>Unformatted National Drug Codes (NDCs) are typically presented as a continuous string of digits without hyphens. Valid examples include <span style="color: blue;">1234567812</span>, <span style="color: blue;">9876543211</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">1234567813</span>. These unformatted NDCs still serve as unique identifiers for drugs, albeit with a lower confidence level due to the lack of clear segmentation.</p>

<p>Other instances of valid unformatted NDCs are <span style="color: blue;">9876512345</span>, <span style="color: blue;">1234512342</span>, <span style="color: blue;">9876523456</span>, <span style="color: blue;">5432167892</span>, <span style="color: blue;">1234578903</span>, <span style="color: blue;">2345612344</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">8765421233</span>. While these drug identification numbers lack hyphens, they still contain the necessary information for medication identification within the FDA's system.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Invalid unformatted NDCs can be identified by their length or composition. For example, <span style="color: blue;">123456789</span> is too short, while <span style="color: blue;">123456789012</span> and <span style="color: blue;">12345678901234</span> are too long to be valid NDCs. Formatted codes like <span style="color: blue;">1234-5678-90</span>, <span style="color: blue;">12345-678-90</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">12345-6789-0</span> should not be considered in this category of unformatted codes.</p>

<p>Other examples of invalid unformatted NDCs include non-numeric strings such as <span style="color: blue;">abcdefghij</span>, or combinations of numbers and letters like <span style="color: blue;">123456789a</span> and <span style="color: blue;">1234567890a</span>. These do not conform to the FDA's standards for drug identification numbers and should not be recognized as valid medication identification codes in any system.</p>
