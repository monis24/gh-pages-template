<h1>Vehicle Identification Number</h1>

<h2>Formatted</h2>

<p>Formatted Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) typically include hyphens to separate different sections of the code. Valid examples include <span style="color: blue;">ABC-12345-D-67890123</span> and <span style="color: blue;">123-ABCDE-F-12345678</span>. These formats make it easier to read and identify the different components of the VIN, such as the manufacturer identifier, vehicle attributes, and serial number. Other valid formatted VINs include <span style="color: blue;">XYZ-98765-G-43210987</span> and <span style="color: blue;">789-HJNPR-Z-09876543</span>.</p>

<p>Additional examples of correctly formatted VINs are <span style="color: blue;">DEF-56789-H-23456789</span>, <span style="color: blue;">456-JNPRZ-J-34567890</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">GHJ-01234-K-45678901</span>. The format typically consists of four groups separated by hyphens, with the third group being a single character. Other valid examples include <span style="color: blue;">NPR-67890-L-56789012</span>, <span style="color: blue;">STU-23456-M-67890123</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">VWX-78901-N-78901234</span>, all following the same pattern.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Invalid formatted VINs often have incorrect lengths or character placements. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">ABC-12345-D-6789012</span> is too short in the last section, while <span style="color: blue;">123-ABCDE-F-123456789</span> is too long. Examples like <span style="color: blue;">XYZ-9876-G-43210987</span> have an incorrectly short second section. VINs containing invalid characters, such as <span style="color: blue;">789-HJNPR-Z-0987654I</span>, are also not valid.</p>

<p>Other invalid formatted VINs include those with incorrect characters in specific positions, like <span style="color: blue;">DEF-56789-O-23456789</span> and <span style="color: blue;">456-JNPRZ-Q-34567890</span>, where 'O' and 'Q' are not typically used in VINs. Examples with incorrect segment lengths, such as <span style="color: blue;">GHJ-01234-K-4567890</span> or <span style="color: blue;">NPR-678-L-5678901A</span>, are invalid. Additionally, VINs with extra hyphens (<span style="color: blue;">STU-23456-M-6789012-3</span>) or spaces (<span style="color: blue;">VWX-78901-N-7890 1234</span>) do not conform to the standard format.</p>

<h2>Unformatted</h2>

<p>Unformatted Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) appear as a continuous string of 17 characters without any separators. Valid examples include <span style="color: blue;">ABC12345D67890123</span> and <span style="color: blue;">123ABCDEF12345678</span>. These unformatted VINs contain the same information as their formatted counterparts but without the visual separation. Other correct unformatted VINs are <span style="color: blue;">XYZ98765G43210987</span> and <span style="color: blue;">789HJNPRZ09876543</span>.</p>

<p>Additional instances of valid unformatted VINs include <span style="color: blue;">DEF56789H23456789</span>, <span style="color: blue;">456JNPRZJ34567890</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">GHJ01234K45678901</span>. The absence of hyphens doesn't affect the validity of the VIN as long as all 17 characters are present and in the correct order. Other examples of correct unformatted VINs are <span style="color: blue;">NPR67890L56789012</span>, <span style="color: blue;">STU23456M67890123</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">VWX78901N78901234</span>.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Invalid unformatted VINs often have incorrect lengths or character compositions. For example, <span style="color: blue;">ABC12345D6789012</span> is too short at 16 characters, while <span style="color: blue;">123ABCDEF123456789</span> is too long at 18 characters. VINs with an incorrect number of characters in specific sections, like <span style="color: blue;">XYZ9876G43210987</span>, are also invalid. The presence of invalid characters, such as in <span style="color: blue;">789HJNPRZ0987654I</span>, renders a VIN incorrect.</p>

<p>Other examples of invalid unformatted VINs include those with characters that are not typically used in VINs, such as <span style="color: blue;">DEF56789O23456789</span> and <span style="color: blue;">456JNPRZQ34567890</span>, where 'O' and 'Q' are present. VINs that are too short, like <span style="color: blue;">GHJ01234K4567890</span>, or contain non-alphanumeric characters, such as <span style="color: blue;">NPR678L5678901A</span> and <span style="color: blue;">STU23456M6789012-3</span>, are invalid. Additionally, VINs with spaces, like <span style="color: blue;">VWX78901N7890 1234</span>, do not conform to the standard unformatted VIN structure.</p>
