<h1>SSN (Social Security Number)</h1>

<h2>Formatted SSN</h2>

<p>Social Security Numbers (SSNs) are typically formatted with specific separators between groups of digits. Valid examples include <span style="color: blue;">123-45-6789</span>, <span style="color: blue;">234 56 7890</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">345.67.8901</span>. These formats use hyphens, spaces, or periods to separate the three groups of digits, making them easily recognizable as SSNs. Another acceptable format uses underscores, as in <span style="color: blue;">456_78_9012</span>.</p>

<p>Other valid examples of formatted SSNs include <span style="color: blue;">567-89-0123</span>, <span style="color: blue;">678 90 1234</span>, <span style="color: blue;">789.01.2345</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">890_12_3456</span>. It's important to note that valid SSNs can start with any digit, including zero, as demonstrated by <span style="color: blue;">001-23-4567</span> and <span style="color: blue;">112 34 5678</span>. The key is maintaining the correct grouping of digits (3-2-4) regardless of the separator used.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Invalid SSNs often violate specific rules set by the Social Security Administration. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">666-12-3456</span> and <span style="color: blue;">000-12-3456</span> are invalid because SSNs don't start with 666 or 000. Similarly, <span style="color: blue;">901-23-4567</span> is invalid as SSNs don't begin with 900 series numbers. Numbers with all zeros in any group, like <span style="color: blue;">123-00-4567</span> or <span style="color: blue;">234-56-0000</span>, are also invalid.</p>

<p>Other examples of invalid formatted SSNs include those with incorrect number of digits, such as <span style="color: blue;">345-67-89012</span> (too many digits) or <span style="color: blue;">456-78-901</span> (too few digits). Improper formatting, like <span style="color: blue;">56789-0123</span> or <span style="color: blue;">678.901234</span>, also renders an SSN invalid. Lastly, SSNs containing non-numeric characters, such as <span style="color: blue;">789-01-234A</span>, are not valid.</p>

<h2>Unformatted SSN</h2>

<p>Unformatted Social Security Numbers appear as a continuous string of nine digits without any separators. Valid examples include <span style="color: blue;">123456789</span>, <span style="color: blue;">234567890</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">345678901</span>. These numbers, while lacking the typical hyphens or spaces, still represent legitimate SSNs. Other valid unformatted SSNs are <span style="color: blue;">456789012</span>, <span style="color: blue;">567890123</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">678901234</span>.</p>

<p>Additional instances of valid unformatted SSNs include <span style="color: blue;">789012345</span>, <span style="color: blue;">890123456</span>, <span style="color: blue;">001234567</span>, and <span style="color: blue;">112345678</span>. As with formatted SSNs, unformatted numbers can start with any digit, including zero. The key is that they contain exactly nine digits in the correct sequence, even without visible grouping.</p>

<p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

<p>Invalid unformatted SSNs often violate the same rules as their formatted counterparts. For example, <span style="color: blue;">666123456</span> and <span style="color: blue;">000123456</span> are invalid because SSNs don't start with 666 or 000. Similarly, <span style="color: blue;">901234567</span> is invalid as SSNs don't begin with 900 series numbers. Numbers with all zeros in any group, like <span style="color: blue;">123004567</span> or <span style="color: blue;">234560000</span>, are also invalid.</p>

<p>Other examples of invalid unformatted SSNs include those with an incorrect number of digits, such as <span style="color: blue;">345678901234</span> (too many digits) or <span style="color: blue;">45678901</span> (too few digits). SSNs containing non-numeric characters, like <span style="color: blue;">567890123A</span>, are not valid. Lastly, numbers that include formatting characters, such as <span style="color: blue;">678-90-1234</span> or <span style="color: blue;">789.01.2345</span>, should not be considered as unformatted SSNs.</p>
