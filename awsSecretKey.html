    <h1 style="font-size: 2em;">AWS Secret Keys</h1>

    <h3>Positive Test Cases</h3>

    <p>In the realm of cloud computing, AWS secret keys play a crucial role in securing access to various services. These keys are designed to be complex and unique, ensuring the highest level of security for user accounts. For instance, the key <span style="color: blue;">q3aDEKvAiN30kAxAbxvE5HHp9N0dDPjiyPEBCZXU</span> demonstrates the intricate nature of these security measures. Similarly, keys like <span style="color: blue;">9Z+88H53QjRktCIAKqzK=pDHXYIe1zZN8Mt3O798</span> and <span style="color: blue;">g2BQxgp1Mu3Cmc3ONK9sTAM0GdhT=fQC3J8MYzaV</span> showcase the diverse character sets used in AWS secret key generation.</p>

    <p>The importance of these aws secret keys cannot be overstated. They serve as the primary means of authentication for programmatic access to AWS services. Examples such as <span style="color: blue;">X3URUBppBCA68rN1oygx1h1gE47Rt6n5AU0SO8Ta</span> and <span style="color: blue;">O6fPKtj98ckqEZvCXtr35jKXoEi6genbMjzwMA=l</span> illustrate the standard 40-character length of these keys. Additional examples like <span style="color: blue;">7twinldxP6OvdAaIuYq6lt76vVKs0MU5Rd0af39k</span> and <span style="color: blue;">sIc=w2gxGuasyARZeLwGUB6lP/A8s/YJ0YapWxCi</span> further demonstrate the randomness and complexity inherent in AWS secret key design.</p>

    <h3>Negative Test Cases</h3>

    <p style="color: red;">The following examples should not be redacted:</p>

    <p>While AWS secret keys follow a specific format, it's crucial to recognize patterns that do not conform to the standard. For instance, <span style="color: blue;">abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789/+</span> may appear similar to a valid key, but it lacks the necessary complexity. Similarly, <span style="color: blue;">aBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ0123456789/+ =</span> and <span style="color: blue;">0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz/+==</span> might seem plausible at first glance, but they don't meet the required criteria for AWS secret keys. It's important to note that strings like <span style="color: blue;">A1B2C3D4E5F6G7H8I9J0KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ/+=!</span> and <span style="color: blue;">abcABC123/+=abcABC123/+=abcABC123/+=ab</span> should not be mistaken for valid keys despite their seemingly complex structure.</p>

    <p>In the process of identifying valid AWS secret keys, it's equally important to recognize patterns that are clearly invalid. For example, repetitive sequences such as <span style="color: blue;">///////////////////////////////////////////////</span> or <span style="color: blue;">+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</span> should be immediately discounted. Similarly, a string consisting solely of equals signs like <span style="color: blue;">======================================</span> does not meet the criteria for a valid AWS secret key. Lastly, while <span style="color: blue;">aB1cD2eF3gH4iJ5kL6mN7pQ8rS9tU0vW/+=#</span> might appear to have the complexity of a secret key, the presence of certain characters and its structure disqualify it from being a valid AWS secret key.</p>
